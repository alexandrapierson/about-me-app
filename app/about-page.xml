        <Label text="Puzzles. I've always been a fan of brain teasers, and coding has been a never ending brain teaser for me. I like having the opportunity to learn, grow and optimize my skill set. There's a level of optimization with all careers, however, there's also a level of limititation. Technology has a higher ceiling for that limitation, and that means there's always going to be new challenges and new puzzles. And thats the main reason that I chose Computer Science." textWrap="true" />
